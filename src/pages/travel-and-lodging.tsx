            <h2>🛬 Flying Into Seattle</h2>
            <p>Seattle’s major airport is the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA).</p>
            <p>To get to the city from the airport, we recommend taking the 1 Line, a Light Rail Train that runs directly from the airport to downtown and beyond. The Light Rail takes about 30 minutes to run from the airport to downtown.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, if you choose to rent a car or use ride share, it’s about a 20 minute drive from the airport to downtown.</p>
            <h2>🚏 Getting Around Seattle</h2>
            <p>There are lots of ways to get around Seattle without a car, including the Light Rail, King County Buses, Seattle Streetcars, Bike & Scooter Sharing, and even the Seattle Center Monorail! More info about these options can be found here.</p>
            <h2>🏞️ Getting to Carkeek Park</h2>
            <p>Carkeek Park is in the Broadview Neighborhood of Seattle, a bit north of downtown. The easiest way to get to the park is by car (~20 minutes from downtown, plenty of parking available), or there are bus route options as well (check your Maps app for best options).</p>
            <p>Here is a diagram for where, specifically, in Carkeek the event will take place:</p>
